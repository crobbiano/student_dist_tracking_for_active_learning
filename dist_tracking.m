%% New script for identifying and splitting students into groups based on
%  their # of standard deviations away from the mean at the end of the 
%  sophomore year.  This should be done at the GPA level.
%
%  Want to then track those groups of students in each of the junior year
%  ECE courses and watch how their distributions change from the sophomore
%  year to the junior year.
%
%  Then compare the changes in these distributions from sophomore year to 
%  junior year for both the students that are pre-KI and post-KI and identify
%  if any differences have occured due to the introduction of the KI.
